# Metronome
Improving the train riding experience for all New Yorkers!

With over 5.5 million daily riders, the NYC metro system is both a blessing but also a headache. How many times have you watched an empty subway car pass by you as it rolls into the station, just to be greeted by a jam-packed car? How many times have you moved down the platform in _hopes_ of ending up with an empty car?

Our team wanted to help New Yorkers experience a less crowded and more efficient commute. There are only a few seconds before each train leaves the station, but plenty of wait time on the platform. We sought out to provide commuters real-time ambient feedback about the capacity of the cars on their upcoming train.
